# WG Code-Quality Charter

## Goals

The Code-Quality Working Group has two goals:

* (short-term) **focus on the improvement of code quality** and
* (long-term) **create an inter-SIG process for identifying, agreeing on and addressing code quality issues**

The long-term goal is achieved when the process is implemented and executed as required.

## Definition of objectives

The main objective of this effort is to improve the quality of the project codebase.

With this in mind, there is a need to define a clear scope on which areas and through what means this can be accomplished.

* Create and maintain code-quality guidelines, best practices and standards.
* Assure distribution of knowledge in regard to code quality.
  * This may include presentations, documentation, lectures, certifications, linters, etc.
* Enforcement of selected standards.
  * Through automation and active intervention in code reviews.
  * Through codebase infrastructure.
* Management:
  * Prioritizing tasks.
  * Focusing on selected topics.
* Monitor and identification of code-quality issues.

## Deliverables

The inter-SIG process definition will be manifested in a document that defines the process itself, also how and when it is executed.
